This plugin employs AES-GCM/SHA-512 encryption to secure your newly created notes. It does not change already created notes. You can have both "*.md" and "*.enc" notes inside your notebook.

#### Features:

1. Encrypts all newly created notes.
2. Encrypted notes remain searchable in Obsidian.
3. Utilizes a native encryption algorithm.

#### How to use:
When creating a new note, it will automatically have a "*.enc" extension. Upon the first use, you will be prompted to set a password.

#### Notes:
It is crucial to remember that there is no possible way to decrypt a note if the password is forgotten.
If you want to bulk convert all your notes to "*.enc", open a bug report.
At this moment, the plugin does not offer any options!
